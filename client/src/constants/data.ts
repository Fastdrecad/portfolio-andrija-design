    description: `This project involved the restoration and modernization of a traditional card catalog cabinet, originally passed down as a family heirloom. The restoration process included both preserving the integrity of the original design while incorporating new functional and aesthetic elements.
    Key features such as the sliding table mechanism, crown molding, and cabinet legs were completely redesigned to enhance both the cabinet's functionality and visual appeal. The project required a deep understanding of woodworking, furniture design, and 3D modeling to achieve a seamless blend of the old and the new. The final design not only restored the cabinet's original beauty but also introduced modern features that make it more functional for contemporary use.`,
